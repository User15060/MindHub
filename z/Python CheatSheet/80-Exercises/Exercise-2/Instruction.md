# Python Exercise

Write a Python program that:

1. Asks the user for their **name**
2. Repeatedly asks for **two numbers** inside a loop
3. Uses a `try/except` block to handle invalid number inputs
4. Adds the two numbers
5. Prints the sum result with the user’s name
6. Asks if the user wants to **continue or quit** the loop

## ✅ Example Output

```
What's your name? User

Welcome User, the sum is: 12

Do you want to add more numbers? (yes/no): yes
Enter first number: 10

Welcome User, the sum is: 30

Do you want to add more numbers? (yes/no): no
