ðŸ§  DEFINITION ðŸ§ 

The `input()` function allows the program to get input from the user during execution.
It always returns a **string**, even if the user types numbers.

âœ… Example:

```python
name = input("What's your name? ")
age = input("What's your age? ")  # age is a string here

# Convert age to integer to use it as a number
age = int(age)

print(f"Hi, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```

ðŸ“Œ Notes:

* `input()` always returns a **string**.
* To use numeric input for calculations, you must convert it with `int()` or `float()`.
