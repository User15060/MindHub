ðŸ§  DEFINITION ðŸ§ 

Conditions are expressions that evaluate to **True** or **False**. They are used in `if`, `while`, and other control structures.

**Comparison operators:**

* `>` : greater than
* `<` : less than
* `>=` : greater than or equal to
* `<=` : less than or equal to
* `==` : equal to
* `!=` : not equal to

**Logical operators:**

* `and` : both conditions must be True
* `or` : at least one condition must be True
* `not` : reverses the condition (True â†’ False, False â†’ True)

âœ… Example:

```python
x = 5
y = 10

print(x > 3 and y < 20)   # True  (both conditions are True)
print(x == 5 or y == 5)   # True  (at least one condition is True)
print(not (x > y))        # True  (because x > y is False)
```
